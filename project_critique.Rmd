## Richard Qiu: Visualization of effects of Medicaid expansion on immunization rates
https://rqiu.shinyapps.io/Vaccine-Explorer/

Richard explored how the expansion of Medicaid through Obamacare impacted public health in the United States by analyzing trends in vaccinations. I like Richard's project because it is very straightforward. The relationship he is studying is very well-defined, and his data is well-suited to answer his questions. The animated plot does a good job of showing change over time. However, I wish there were trendlines or descriptions of how strong the trends are and what further implications this might have.
